# AutoBackupScript
This program is used to automate the backup process.

# My Bash Project

This project is a simple Bash script designed to facilitate backup, listing, and restoration of files. Currently, the script offers three main functionalities:

1. **Backup:** The backup function creates an archive containing specified files.

2. **Listing:** The listing function displays the list of existing backups.

3. **Restoration:** The restoration function allows you to restore a previously made backup.

## Features to Add

While the script currently has basic features, the goal is to expand its capabilities. Here are some features to be added in the future:

- **Automatic Backup with Cron:** Automate backups using scheduled cron tasks.

- **Logging:** Add logging features to track script operations.

- **Archive Compression:** Improve efficiency by adding options for compressing archives.

- **Notifications:** Integrate notifications to inform users about backup status.

- **Backup Encryption:** Enhance security by adding encryption features to backups.
